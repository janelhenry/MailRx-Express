## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** EJS, Tailwind, JavaScript, MongoDB

Explore the architecture of MailRx Express, a fullstack mail order pharmacy onboarding app designed for efficiency and security. Utilizing EJS for dynamic HTML, I seamlessly integrate JavaScript to enhance user interactions. The backend framework is powered by Node.js and Express, ensuring swift and scalable performance. Passport.js, a key component of my authentication strategy, facilitates a secure user login process. This authentication middleware seamlessly integrates with the application, allowing for flexible and modular authentication strategies. Tailwind CSS adds a touch of professionalism with a clean and visually appealing design. Finally, MongoDB, is my secure data repository of choice for patient information. MailRx Express embodies the several technologies, delivering a seamless and professional pharmacy onboarding experience.



## Future Optimizations

As I continuously strive to enhance the MailRx Express experience, I have exciting plans to introduce an onboarding form feature in upcoming releases. This onboarding form will revolutionize user engagement by providing a streamlined process for gathering essential information such as patient details (name, birthday, gender, etc.) and prescriber information. My vision is to create a seamless onboarding experience that not only captures necessary data efficiently but also ensures the security and privacy of user information. Stay tuned for updates as I work to bring this valuable addition to MailRx Express, making the onboarding process even more user-friendly and comprehensive.

## Lessons Learned:

Through the development of MailRx Express, I gained invaluable insights into the delicate balance between functionality and aesthetics. Embracing the fact that I don't need to be a designer to infuse beauty into my code, I opted for Tailwind CSS components to enhance the visual appeal of the application. While navigating Tailwind, I encountered challenges, such as configuring the necessary code snippets in my auth.js file. Persistence and a willingness to learn guided me through these hiccups, relying on trial and error to refine my understanding. Additionally, I discovered the importance of taking breaks when faced with roadblocks. Stepping away and returning with a fresh perspective proved instrumental in debugging code and approaching challenges with renewed clarity.
